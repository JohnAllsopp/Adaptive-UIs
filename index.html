<h1>Contextually Responsive Web Experiences</h1>

<p>There's no hotter adjective in web design right now than "responsive", but this time the hype is no doubt warranted. The term "Responsive Web Design", coined by Ethan Marcotte in May 2010, but with roots far older, more than anything named a trend that had been gaining momentum for some time, just as <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications">Jesse James Garrett's coining of the term Ajax</a> gave a name to a technique of web app development which helped kick start the web app revolution.</p>

<p>But as important as RWD is, it still focusses on the visual, on screen sizes and resolutions, and how to make a design work seamlessly across a broad range of devices. We might think of it as "Device-Responsive Web Design".</p>

<p>At the heart of RWD is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries">media query</a>, a wonderful CSS feature that allows us to tailor a design based on the display characteristics of a device. Most commonly it's used to ensure designs can adapt to the width (and to a lesser degree height) and screen resolution of a device.</p>

<p>RWD is something we spoke about for many years before Ethan coined the term, indeed Ethan generously quotes my "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao">A Dao of Web Design</a>" from April 2000in the article he wrote for A List Apart which introduced the term. What made this for a long time largely theoretically interesting  topic <em>practically</em> important was, above all else, the rise of a genuinely usable mobile web, which I'd argue was ushered in by the release of the iPhone.</p>

<p>But the iPhone, and the subsequent panoply of other sophisticated mobile and later tablet platforms didn't only bring different screen sizes and resolutions. Their revolution wasn't only visual. They made the use of the web start happening in all sorts of places it rarely if ever had taken place before. And, on board these devices typically have</p>

<ul>
	<li>accelerometer (that allow developers to determine how the device is moving in 3 dimensional space)</li>
	<li>gyroscopes (that allow us to determine how a device is oriented, bot just in portrait or landscape, but in a full three dimensions)</li>
	<li>GPS chips, (or wifi triangulation) that allow us to pinpoint the location on earth of these devices to within meters most places they are likely to go</li>
	<li>magnetometer (in essence a compass)</li>
</ul>

<p>In recent years, more and more of these device capabilities have been made available to web developers through various Device APIs. You've probably heard a fair bit about them, but typically they're pigeon-holed them as being for developers of mapping systems, games, and similar complex apps, but of no real use for "plain old web sites". I'd like you to rethink this assumption.</p>

<h2>Introducing <em>Context</em> Responsive Web Designs</h2>

<p>Just as Responsive Web Design is about tailoring designs to the physical characteristics of a device, particularly its screen, I'm interested in how we can tailor a design to the physical <em>context</em> of the device (and its user).</p>

<p>Using the various device APIs, we can know, or at least guess at, all sorts of things about the user's context</p>

<ul>
	<li>are they travelling in a car? an aircraft? a boat?</li>
	<li>is their device quite still, or shaking dramatically?</li>
	<li>is the device lying flat on a surface, or being held in a hand</li>
	<li>is the user walking? Running? Riding a bicycle? Snowboarding?</li>
</ul>

<p>We can determine all these sorts of thing about a user using these device APIs alone, and a little bit of clever calculation.</p>

<p>Throw a few web based APIs into the mix (such as a mapping API or a weather API) and we can start making guesses about a whole lot of other things about them. Are they on a train? a bus? In their office? Carrying an umbrella? Waiting to watch a movie? Waiting for the 389 bus?</p>

<p>But what's the point of us being able to know this sort of thing, particularly when developing "plain old web sites". Right now, tailoring a design based on screen characteristics is a definite improvement over what came before. But what if we could tailor a design for people who suffer from tremors, people with conditions like Parkinson's Disease, so that buttons or links became much easier to hit when a phone was shaking significantly (this would also benefit users without such a physical condition say strap-hanging on their commute to work). Or, what if we could adapt our designs to only show the most cogent information (headlines at a news site) while a user were running down the street? Or ask them whether they really want to play our game when they are in a car travelling at 80kph?</p>

<p>Sounds complicated? Certainly, we have to go beyond CSS media queries, but I've done some of the heavy lifting for you, with a proof of concept JavaScript library, AdaptiveUI, and examples. You can find <a href="https://github.com/JohnAllsopp/Adaptive-UIs">AdaptiveUI on Github</a>, so feel free to clone it and play around.</p>

<p>In this first iteration, AdaptiveUI can determine whether the device is shaking (perhaps because of a medical condition the user has, perhaps because of the current physical context of the user, but the net result is the same, there'll be actions it's harder to perform than if the phone were being held in a stable way).</p>

<p>If AdaptiveUI determines that the phone is shaking, it adds the value <code>shaking</code> to the list of classNames for the <code>body</code> (and if it isn't shaking, it adds a different class value). Then, all we need to do is use this to style elements differently depending on the context. If you want to take a look at this in action, visit <a href="http://webdirections.org/adaptiveUIs/keypad.html">our demo site</a> with a device which supports <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=motion">devicemotion and deviceorientation</a> events (which includes iOS 4.2 and up, Android 3 and up, Blackberry 10, among others). Then, start shaking the phone and after a few seconds, the UI adapts with the target size for each button increasing if the phone is shaking.</p>

	</figure>

<p>Now, I'm not saying this is a perfect (or even necessarily very good) UI as implemented. As mentioned, it's a proof of concept, that I hope might interest designers and developers in the idea that our designs can adapt to the user's context. Even "plain old web sites" can benefit. Here's the site design for our recent Web Directions Code conference for smaller screens.</p>

	<figcaption>Web Directions Code site when the phone is not shaking</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>But, if our user is on the move, or in a context where reading detail is difficult, we might deliver a design that presents only the <strong>most</strong> pertinent information.</p>

	<figure>
	<img src="images/codeShaken.png" alt="Screenshot of the Web Directions Code site when the phone is shaking">
	<figcaption>Web Directions Code site when the phone is shaking</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>Again, a proof of concept, rather than a design I'd stake my life on.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The next steps for AdaptiveUI is to broaden the range of contexts it can provide information about. So, it will be able to provide a guess, and degree of confidence, for whether a user is walking, running, travelling in a car, and other common circumstances.</p>

<p>I wrote A Dao of Web Design just on 13 years ago. The ideas in it started to really take off only a decade or so later. Hopefully, if there's something to the idea of Contextually Responsive Web Design, it won't take quite so long.</p>
