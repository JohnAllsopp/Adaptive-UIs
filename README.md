Adaptive-UIs
============

Experiments in *really* adaptive/responsive user experiences for the web

Responsive web designs have been a revolution on web design. But we can go further than just tailoring our designs based on the user's device characteristics.
AdaptiveUI is a proof of concept experiment in adapting designs to the *context* of the user (are they shaking, walking, running, among other things)
